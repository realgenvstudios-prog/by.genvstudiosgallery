This project is a modern portfolio website for a creative business, built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Prioritize clean, maintainable code and match the Figma design closely. Use semantic HTML, accessible components, and utility-first styling. All sections should be easily updatable.
